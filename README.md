Introduction
------------

This is the start of a cleaned port of LZHAM written by Richard Geldreich, Jr.
The aim of this project is to make it more portable but maintain compatibility
with the original LZHAM project.  The hope is to possibly create a cleaner base
that can be merged back into the original project and maybe forked off if I
am inspired to make incompatible changes for the better.

Directions of this port include:

- C compatible port
- Integration into unix like tools, ala XZ is to 7Z.
- Improvements in performance
